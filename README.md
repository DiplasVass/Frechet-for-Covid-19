This project covers five learning outcomes: learning new probability; derivative cdf from pdf; inverse transformation method; maximum likelihood estimation; and analysis of covid data.
In the recent study of the mortality rate of COVID-19, researchers found that the mortality rate follows a
probability distribution named Kies FrÂ´echet distribution (https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330224/)
